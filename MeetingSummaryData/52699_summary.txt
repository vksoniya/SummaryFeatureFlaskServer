Social robots are typically more human-like in design, and embody a number of social behaviours, from speech to gestures to eye gaze . They can also be applied in many different domains such as healthcare, education, retail, and entertainment . However, the design and implementation of such robots is still in the beginning stages . The topic we discuss today is under the domain called as Human-Robot Interaction and under the second domain of pyschology.
